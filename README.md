AJAX Phone Directory Search

This is a simple AJAX live search for a campus phone and mailbox directory project.

It is built using PHP, MySQL, jQuery, and Ben Alman's "jQuery throttle/debounce" plugin.

It was initially made available as both a web app and Adobe AIR application.

The user front end is encapsulated in the phonedir.html file with the backend query logic taking place in the phoneresults.php file. This separation should make it easy to duplicate in another language.
